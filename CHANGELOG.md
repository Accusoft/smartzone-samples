    and [Accusoft.SmartZoneOCRSdk.SmartZoneException](https://help.accusoft.com/SmartZone/latest/dotnet/webframe.html#Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Net~Accusoft.SmartZoneOCRSdk.SmartZoneException.html)
    now derive from System.Exception instead of System.ApplicationException.
- Unsupported characters have been removed from all predefined character sets in the [CharacterSet](https://help.accusoft.com/SmartZone/latest/dotnet/webframe.html#Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Net~Accusoft.SmartZoneOCRSdk.CharacterSet.html) class.

- Some native libraries that were previously integrated in the **Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Net** assembly are now included as separate dlls. These libraries will be extracted to the same directory as the assembly when using the Nuget Package. The libraries are named **Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Common.dll** and **Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.Common64.dll** on Windows. For Linux distributions, the name of the file is **Accusoft.SmartZoneOCR.CommonLinux64.so**. These need to be included when redistributing any application that uses the SmartZoneOCR SDK.
